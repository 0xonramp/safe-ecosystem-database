## What is it?

This database maintains a list of confirmed internal and external integrations to the safe services. Internal integrations, e.g. blocknative or tenderly and external integrations e.g. Metropolis or Onchain Den.

**This is useful to:**

- Get a holistic picture and understanding of the ecosystem
- Allow Safe stakeholders to quickly navigate the ecosystem
- Identify opportunities for the Safe ecosystem
- Understanding which safe services are most in use
- Understanding the level of integrations

**The database keeps track of the following integrations:**

- Core SDK
    - Core AA SDK
    - Safe Apps SDK
- Core Protocol
    - Modules
    - Guards
    - Contracts
- Core API
    - Transaction Service
    - Client Gateway
    - …
- Networks
- And more!

## How do I use it?

If you have:

- Integrated with a project making use of Safe services
- Discovered a project making use of Safe services

You can add it to the ecosystem database. 

**Make sure to check for duplicates to avoid double entries.**

## Which projects don’t qualify?

- Hackathon projects that are non-maintained
- Projects that have a non-technical collaboration
